# Make a Quote Generator

In this folder you will find the basic setup of an alarm clock.

You can change any of the files in this project

## How the Quote Generator should work

When the page loads it should show a random quote from the `quotes` array on the screen. It should also show who said the quote.

When you click a button on the screen it should change the quote on the screen.

It can look however you like but there is an example in this folder at `quote_generator_example.png`

## New Help?

- Can't work out how to find a random element from the array?
  - Just using `Math.random()`
